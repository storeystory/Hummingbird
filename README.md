Hummingbird is a simple word processing app useful for writing Twitter threads. Intended for microfiction, it can be a tool you leave running in the background if you're like me and write in fits and starts throughout the day. It keeps track of the character limit and helps you to visualize where the breaks between tweets happen in your writing. 

Hummingbird autosaves frequently by spitting a file out into the directory where it is located, and exports files in the same way. So keep it in its own directory.
