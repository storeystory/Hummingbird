Hummingbird is a simple word processing app useful for writing Twitter threads. Intended for microfiction, it can be a tool you leave running in the background if you're like me and write in short spurts throughout the day. It keeps track of Twitter's character limit and helps you to visualize where the breaks happen in your writing. 

Hummingbird autosaves frequently by spitting a file out into the directory where it is located, and exports in the same way. So keep it in its own directory.
